# OP_Battleship_UI

Game made using object-oriented Java with a JavaFX user interface

Programmers – Sander Põldma, Gerdo Germann

Based on the classic board and online game "Battleship", this version improves on the original [console-based version](https://github.com/Spoldma/OP_Battleship) by adding a graphical user interface built with **JavaFX**. Developed by two computer science students at the University of Tartu, the game introduces a unique twist: instead of traditional ship units, the game features mine-like elements as ships. Your opponent is the computer.

At the start of the game, you can select the gameboard dimensions and the number of ships to place. Find and destroy all enemy ships before yours are gone – and you win.

Have fun playing and feel free to give feedback!
